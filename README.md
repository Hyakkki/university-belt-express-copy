## Student-Friendly Food Delivery App  

## Overview  
**UBELT-ExPress** is a **food delivery application** inspired by **Foodpanda**, made specifically for students within the **U-Belt** area of Manila. It’s designed to offer a fast, convenient, and budget-conscious way to order food from nearby restaurants. The project is currently in the early stages, with the **UI design** and **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** in progress. Future plans include implementing key features similar to Foodpanda, such as restaurant listings, place orders, and a built in e-wallet.
